CORGI Version 1.0    {#corgi_readme}
=================

CORGI is a C++ [entity-component system][] library developed primarily for
games that focus on simplicity and flexibility.

The core functionality of CORGI is provided by the following classes:
   * Component
      - An object that contains the logic and data pertaining to a particular
        system in the game.
   * Entity
      - The basic building block of a game, that does not do much on its own. It
        can be associated with many Components to achieve more complex behavior.
   * Entity Manager
      - This is a the object that ties Entities and Components together. It acts
        as the main point of interface for game logic to create Entities and
        register them with Components.

The library is written in portable C++ and has been tested on the following
platforms:

   * [Android][]
   * [Linux][] (x86_64)
   * [OS X][]
   * [WIndows][]
